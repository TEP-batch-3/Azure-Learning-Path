# Function App: Find Broken Azure API Connections
Developing solutions on Azure is sometimes an effortless operation. Administrate all your Azure resources that may be a different story. And this PowerShell script focuses on simplifying one of these processes.

One of the painful processes, not only when we are developing our Logic App, but mainly when we are administrating them, is finding what API Connections that are broken or in error.

This PowerShell Function App will look at all of the API Connections in all resource groups present in a specific Azure Subscription and provide a list of all broken API Connections.
