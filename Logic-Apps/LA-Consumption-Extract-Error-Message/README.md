## POC: Logic App (Consumption) Extract Error Message From Logic App Run History

# Introduction
What we pretend to do is to create a Logic App that can dynamically catch the real error inside a run from another logic app. When we say real error, it means that sometimes errors like “An action failed. No dependent actions succeeded.” tells us nothing about what really happened during the workflow, and we need to dig deeper to find the real error behind it
