# Logic Apps
This is my public repository for sharing any kind of resources regarding Azure Logic Apps

Azure Logic Apps is a cloud-based platform for creating and running automated logic app workflows that integrate your apps, data, services, and systems. With this platform, you can develop highly scalable integration solutions for your enterprise and business-to-business (B2B) scenarios. To create a logic app, you use the Logic App (Consumption) resource type or the Logic App (Standard) resource type. The Consumption resource type runs in the multi-tenant Azure Logic Apps or integration service environment, while the Standard resource type runs in a single-tenant Azure Logic Apps environment.

Logic Apps is a "block building" type of programming that allows you to create applications by using the visual designer, which requires minimal code. It consists of a series of actions, each of which is a logical step in the workflow implementation process. These actions can express conditionals (if statements), loops, and more. Critically, a logic app can also use actions to call external software and services.
Some advantages or benefits of using Logic Apps are: 
 * **Designer-first (declarative)**: You design complex processes by using easy-to-understand design tools and implementing patterns and workflows seamlessly that might otherwise be difficult to implement in code.
 * **Flexible and scalable**: Logic Apps is a cloud-based, serverless computing service. This means it automatically scales and adapts to meet the needs of the business.
 * **Connects to anything**: You can use Azure Logic Apps to integrate most business systems, including BizTalk Server, APIs, SaaS, and on-premises applications or systems, and nearly all Azure Services like API management, Azure Functions, Azure Service Bus and many others.
